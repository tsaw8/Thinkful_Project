    "In this assignment, we will revisit the house price model and focus on the problem of __overfitting__ and __underfitting__. Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data, thus producing poor results. On the other hand, an underfitted model will have poor performance on the training data and new data. A good model should be able to __generalize__ and reduce the __generalization gap__ which is the difference between the erros in the test and training set. As a general rule, if our model is too complex, it will tend to overfit. Inversely, if our model is not complex enough, it will underfit the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also try different regression model, which incorportate __regularization__, the process of modifying algorithms in order to lower the generalization gap without sacrificing training performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing the best hyperparameter values for our models, we will use __k-fold cross-validation__. We will split the data into 5 random folds to estimate the skill fo the model on unseen data. "
