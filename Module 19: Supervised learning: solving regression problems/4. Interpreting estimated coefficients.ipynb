    "Based on the estimated model provided, 875 is the inetercept of the model. The relationship between annual income and recreational expenditure appears to be quadratic. The coefficient of annual income is 0.0012. As a person's annual income increases by one year, her/his recreational expenditure increases by \\\\$0.0012 on average. As the annual income is squared, the expenditure increases by \\\\$0.0002. Those with children, will spend \\\\$223.57 per child less than those without children. \n",

    "In order to determine whether the coefficent is statistically insignificant, we can use the summary() function to returns t-statistics and associated p-values. The p-value associated with a t-test quantifies the likelihood that the estimated coefficient is actually equal to zero in the real population. The lower the p-value, the more significant the coefficient is. As a general rule of thumb, when the p-value of a coefficient is less than or equal to 0.1, we say that the coefficient is statistically significant. However, it's admirable to have a p-value that is less than or equal to 0.05.\n"
