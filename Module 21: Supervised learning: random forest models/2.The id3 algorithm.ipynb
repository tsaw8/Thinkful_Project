    " * Partition (\"split\") the set S into subsets using the attribute for which the resulting entropy after splitting is minimized; or, equivalently, information gain is maximum\n",
    " * Make a decision tree node containing that attribute.\n",
    " * Recurse on subsets using the remaining attributes.\n",
