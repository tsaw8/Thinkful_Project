    "_1. Let's assume that you have World Bank data on financial, economic and social indicators for several countries. You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?_\n",

    " - OLS is a special type of linear regression models\n",
    "  - Linear regression uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm to optimize the best fit line. OLS tries to minimize the sum of the squared distances between each point and the line, and it chooses the line that minimizes this sum. This minimization is the optimization that the linear regression method does.<br>\n",

    "    -  The relationship between feature(s) and target(s) is linear.\n",
    "    -  The errors of the model should be equal to zero on average.\n",
    "    -  The model’s errors are consistently distributed, which is known as heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "    -  Features are at most only weakly correlated. Put differently there is not strong multicollinearity.\n",
    "    -  The model’s errors should be uncorrelated with each other.\n",
    "    -  The features and model errors are independent of one another.\n",
