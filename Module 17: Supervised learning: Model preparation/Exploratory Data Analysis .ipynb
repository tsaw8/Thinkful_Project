    "#### 2. Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. Each review is scored as a Likert-style survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's website.\n",

    "_a. What problems do you expect to find in the raw data?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous challenges may appear in an Likert-style survey. For example, a format for entering data may not have been established, leading to various forms of responses. If the data was not entered as numeric values from 1 to 5, we may have to identify key words that correlate to each sentiment score. In addition, there could also be symbols, spacing issues, and missing values. \n",

    "_b. If your task is to build features that give information about customer sentiments, how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I would open the dataset in Excel and skim through a 100 rows to identity common trends of sentiment scores.  Next, I would attempt to establish a common format by converting all inputs as strings. If there are numeric values, I would convert those to the corresponding sentiment word. With the trends that were identified, I would also implement it in this step. To check my progress, I would group the data by sentiment scores and check for scores that occurred only once. If the number of scores that occurred only once decreases after each format conversion, I would deem this as a success. \n",

    "In order to identify potentially useful features from raw data, it would need to be processed. I might consider running the describe function to see how many unique outcomes there are. As previously mentioned, I would also group by sentiment score to see what are the most frequently occurring data points. Then, I would compare to see if there are any similarities between sentiment scores with high and low occurrence. \n"
